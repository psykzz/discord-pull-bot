  `If laughter is the best medicine, your face must be curing the world.`,
  `The only way you'll ever get laid is if you crawl up a chicken's ass and wait.`,
  `It looks like your face caught fire and someone tried to put it out with a hammer.`,
  `If I wanted a bitch, I'd have bought a dog.`,
  `I'd like to see things from your point of view, but I can't seem to get my head that far up your ass.`,
  `I've seen people like you before, but I had to pay admission.`,
  `Scientists say the universe is made up of neutrons, protons and electrons. They forgot to mention morons.`,
  `You're so fat you could sell shade.`,
  `Why is it acceptable for you to be an idiot but not for me to point it out?`,
  `Your lips keep moving but all I hear is "Blah, blah, blah."`,

  `Which sexual position produces the ugliest children? Ask your mother.`,
  `Stupidity's not a crime, so you're free to go.`,
  `If I had a face like yours I'd sue my parents.`,
  `Your doctor called with your colonoscopy results. Good news - they found your head.`,
  `No, those pants don't make you look fatter - how could they?`,
  `What's the difference between your girlfriend and a walrus? One has a moustache and smells of fish and the other is a walrus.`,

  `Jesus loves you... but everyone else thinks you're an asshole.`,
  `Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed.`,
  `I was hoping for a battle of wits but you appear to be unarmed.`,
  `Hey, you have something on your chin... no, the 3rd one down.`,
  `Aww, it's so cute when you try to talk about things you don't understand.`,
  `I don't know what makes you so stupid, but it really works.`,
  `You are proof that evolution can go in reverse.`,
  `Brains aren't everything. In your case they're nothing.`,
  `I thought of you today. It reminded me to take the garbage out.`,
  `You're so ugly when you look in the mirror, your reflection looks away.`,
  `When you were born, the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to your dad, "I'm very sorry. We did everything we could. But he pulled through."`,
  `I'm sorry I didn't get that - I don't speak idiot.`,
  `Quick - check your face! I just found your nose in my business.`,
  `It's better to let someone think you're stupid than open your mouth and prove it.`,
  `Hey, your village called - they want their idiot back.`,
  `Were you born this stupid or did you take lessons?`,
  `I've been called worse by better.`,
  `You're such a beautiful, intelligent, wonderful person. Oh I'm sorry, I thought we were having a lying competition.`,
  `I may love to shop but I'm not buying your bull.`,
  `Don't you get tired of putting make up on two faces every morning?`,
  `I'd slap you but I don't want to make your face look any better.`,
  `Calling you an idiot would be an insult to all stupid people.`,
  `Gay? I'm straighter than the pole your mom dances on.`,
  `I just stepped in something that was smarter than you... and smelled better too.`,
  `You have the right to remain silent because whatever you say will probably be stupid anyway.`,
